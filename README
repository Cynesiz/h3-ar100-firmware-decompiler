To ease reverse engineering of the firmware for H3, you can use script that
takes arisc_sun8iw7p1.bin file (available in the lichee h3 sdk from Draco) and
produces readable pseudocode. Pseudocode is split into cross-referenced
functions and basic blocks, code within basic blocks is emulated and register
assignments use evaluated values if known. Memory and register addresses are
renamed based on the map of known locations. Most of the functions are named
based on their purpose.

Code can be used to understand the suspend/resume function in H3 in particular
and write a mainline implementataion.
